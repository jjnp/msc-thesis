% findings:
% 1) briefly re-state the prelim results
% 2) traefik resource results, nothing special, BUT: respone time increases ram load
% 3) in such a situation, lb placement and information is even more critical, than assumed. i.e. the more sparse close resources the more extreme the rest
% 4) information entropy role, shows clear advantage of entropy -> further justification that we need to schedule efficiently
% 5) weight range can and should be quite large, same with the scaling. Perf spread role in this. Also: results from experiments on which WRR implementation is correct etc.
% 6) ????



% 1) Prelims
% 2) traefik resource eval
% 3) more realistic topo
% 4) load balancer count testsPrel
% 5) LB hyperparameter tests
% 6) the osmotic stuffs?
