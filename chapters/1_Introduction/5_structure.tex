\section{Structure}
Chapter 2 provides relevant background information for the technological environment this work is embedded in. In particular it outlines the concept of serverless computing, serverless edge computing, as well as describing the concepts of load balancing and service placement.
Chapter 3 explores the related work, highlighting which other works are most directly related to this one, and describing how this thesis differs from them.
Chapter 4 describes our proposed approach. After a brief overview of the general concept, it gives insight into our view of the problem domain, followed by detailed explanations of our approach and the rationale that led to it.
Chapter 5 describes the methodologies we used when evaluating our approach, explaining the serverless function as well as its relevant components, and how it informs its simulation with data from experiments on actual hardware.
Chapter 6 contains the evaluations of our approach, detailing both experiment setups and results.
These results are then discussed in chapter 7, where their implications for serverless edge, but also the limitations of our approach are explained.
Lastly, chapter 8 concludes this thesis and gives and outlook on future work.
