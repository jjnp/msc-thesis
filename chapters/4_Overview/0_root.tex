\chapter{Overview}
The goal of this chapter is to give an overview of the general evaluation setup and methodology behind our approach, as this ties together the relation between our approach and its evaluation.
First, the approach we present is the result of several iterations of design and experimentation, as one would expect in the field of distributed systems engineering.
While the evaluation, of course, focuses on evaluating the solution we propose, we also include some of the experiments that led to the design and parametrization of our approach.
We decided to include these, as they highlight the broader problem area our approach addresses, and we believe them to be helpful for a deeper understanding of how our approach works.

Second, we mostly rely on simulated environments for the development and evaluation of our approach, because actual deployments in systems of the size this work addresses are infeasible, at least in the context of this work.
Thus we also use this chapter to explain the simulation environment in detail to make results more transparent, and give subsequent research the chance to potentially build not only on the results of this work, but on the environment it is built upon.
