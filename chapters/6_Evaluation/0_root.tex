\chapter{Evaluation}

% Stuff that goes here:
% Faas-sim: what is it, how does it work, what are its models, how does it deal with containers/kubernetes/openfaas/etc. What is simulated, what isn't? How are network flows simulated?
% Request pattern stuff.
% what types devices are there
% what functions are there, how do they perform on each device?
% image sizes, pulls, request payload sizes, all that stuff
% topologies: What are there and how are they built? real measurements from papers, etc. etc.
% -> city level, both old and modern, visualizations, etc.

% practical: how did we eval traefik
% real cluster, galileo (briefly), what devices are there? Auto-responder type app, payload size, response time, etc.

% Experiments:
% 1) Prelims
% 2) traefik resource eval
% 3) more realistic topo
% 4) load balancer count tests
% 5) LB hyperparameter tests
% 6) the osmotic stuffs?
